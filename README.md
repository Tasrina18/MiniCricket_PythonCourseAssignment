# MiniCricket_PythonCourseAssignment
🏅 Purpose of This Project

This was my first Python certification assignment, designed to strengthen fundamentals like loops, conditionals, functions, and random number generation.
I uploaded it to GitHub as part of documenting my coding journey.

🧠 Game Rules (Simplified)

Choose H or T for the toss

Winner of the toss chooses to bat first (in this version: user bats if they win)

Each "ball":

Batter enters a number between 0–6

Bowler (computer/user) generates a random number between 0–6

If both numbers match → OUT

Runs are added until the batter gets OUT

Second innings begins

Higher total wins the match

🔮 Future Improvements

Add overs and wickets

Add difficulty levels

Add scoreboard UI
