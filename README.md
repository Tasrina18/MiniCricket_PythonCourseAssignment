# MiniCricket_PythonCourseAssignment
🏏 Hand Cricket Game (Python)

A simple console-based Hand Cricket Game.
The game simulates a cricket match between the user and the computer using random numbers.

🏅 Purpose of This Project

This was my first Python certification assignment, designed to strengthen fundamentals like loops, conditionals, functions, and random number generation.
I uploaded it to GitHub as part of documenting my coding journey.
